# Booking.com search

Search live Booking.com stays via [ScoutingAPI](https://scoutingapi.com) — one call, the same unified schema you use for Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and Google Hotels.

## Setup

If `$SCOUTINGAPI_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md) and follow it to get and store the key. A `scout_test_` sandbox key works for evaluation at zero cost.

## When to use this skill

**DO use when the user asks:**

- "Find Booking.com places in Split, HR for mid-July"
- "Search Booking.com for a 2-bed under a budget"

**Do NOT use when:**

- A location appears incidentally in conversation
- The user has one known listing already — use the availability or prices skill

## Required headers

Every request needs:

- **Authorization:** `Bearer $SCOUTINGAPI_KEY`
- **User-Agent:** your agent's name (e.g. `ClaudeCode/1.0`).

Base URL: `https://api.scoutingapi.com/v1`.

## Tools

### `GET /v1/search`

Discover properties matching a location, dates, occupancy and filters across one or more platforms. Results from every requested platform are normalized to the same Property shape and merged into a single, cursor-paginated list. This is the breadth / funnel endpoint — and the clearest demonstration of "one schema, every platform".

Key parameters:
- `location` — Place name ("Split, HR") or "lat,lng". Required.
- `checkIn` — YYYY-MM-DD; required if checkOut given; not in the past.
- `checkOut` — YYYY-MM-DD; required if checkIn given; must be after checkIn.
- `adults` — ≥ 1.
- `children` — ≥ 0.
- `childAges[]` — Length must equal children. Coarsened for Vrbo/Airbnb.


> Filter results to Booking.com by passing `platforms=booking` to the search call.

## MCP (no key pasted into the agent)

On an MCP-capable runtime, connect `https://mcp.scoutingapi.com` (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE) and use: `search_stays`.

## The cross-OTA advantage

ScoutingAPI is **cross-platform**: Booking.com data comes back in the *same unified schema* as Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and Google Hotels, and the price-compare tool returns a computed **min** and **median** across every OTA — something a single-platform wrapper can't do.

## Async & partial failures

A live call that has to scrape returns `202` + a `jobId`; poll `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}` (free) until `data.status` is `completed`, then read `data.result`. On a fan-out, check `meta.partial` and `meta.platformResults[]`.

## Credits

Number-free by design — **failed, empty and blocked calls are never billed**, and `scout_test_` sandbox calls are always free. Current costs: <https://scoutingapi.com/pricing> · full contract: <https://api.scoutingapi.com/openapi.json>.
